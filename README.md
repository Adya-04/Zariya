# 🌟 Zariya – A Pathway to Dignity & Employment

**Zariya** is a social impact application designed to bridge the gap between **underprivileged individuals (like roadside beggars)** and **job opportunities in labor-based industries**. It empowers society to act as connectors, helping bring dignity and employment to those often left behind.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

Every day, we see people capable of working but stuck in poverty due to lack of awareness or access. At the same time, industries struggle to fill vacancies for roles like cleaning staff, helpers, etc.

**Zariya** provides a platform where **bystanders (citizens)** can recommend **fit but unemployed individuals** for **verified job listings** — and in return, earn a small commission once the job is secured.

---

## 🧠 Core Features

- 🔍 **Job Discovery**: Explore available labor-based jobs listed by industries.
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Third-Party Referrals**: Citizens can refer unemployed individuals (e.g., beggars) they come across.
- 📄 **Minimal Documentation**: Easy job application process with simple detail submission.
- 💸 **Commission System**: Referrers earn a commission from the hiring organization once placement is successful.
- 🤝 **Transparent Flow**: Ensures both the individual and organization are updated throughout the process.

We believe that technology is most powerful when it uplifts.
With Zariya, we’re not just building an app — we’re building hope, one opportunity at a time.
